My APCS independent study first semester project.  It functions like Pandora in that you can pick a certain genre and listen to music.

Disclaimer: I did not create any of the music used in the project. I payed for all of it myself, and converted the MP3 files to WAV.
I also did not create the cover images, I retrieved them from Google Images.
